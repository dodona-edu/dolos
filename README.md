Dolos is a source code plagiarism detection tool for programming exercises.
Dolos helps teachers in discovering students sharing solutions, even if they are
modified. By providing interactive visualizations, Dolos can also be used to
sensitize students to prevent plagiarism.

Dolos aims to be:

- **Easy to use** by having minimal installation instructions and an intuitive user interface
- **Flexible** to support many programming languages
- **Powerful** by using state-of-the-art algorithms to help you discover plagiarism

Dolos is a command-line (CLI) tool that analyses source code files for similarities between them.
It is able to show an interactive user interface in your browser by launching a local webserver.
The analysis results are available in machine readable CSV files and Dolos can be integrated as a
[JavaScript library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dodona/dolos-lib) in other applications empowering
users to integrate plagiarism detection in their personal workflow.

## Installation

You can install Dolos on your system using npm:
```shell
npm install -g @dodona/dolos
```

See [the installation instructions on our website](https://dolos.ugent.be/guide/installation.html) for more complete instructions.

## Usage

Dolos has to be launched using the command-line interface, but it is able to
show the results in your browser.

Launch Dolos using the following command in your terminal:
```shell
dolos run -f web --language <language> path/to/your/files/*
```
The above command will launch a web interface with the analysis results at <http://localhost:3000>.

## Building and developing

If you want to build Dolos from source you will need
[yarn (v1)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) because this project
uses [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) to
combine the dependencies of each project (cli, web and docs).

You only need to run install the dependencies once in the repository root by
running `yarn install`. This will install all dependencies and link them in each
project's `node_modules`. You should **not** run `yarn install` in each
project's directory separately.

This will also link the `dist` folder from the web and lib projects as
`dolos-web` and `dolos-lib` in the CLI project as long as the
`cli/package.json` mentions `@dodona/dolos-web` and `@dodona/dolos-lib` with
the correct version as a dependency. This allows you to simultaneously develop
the CLI, lib and the web project together.

Each project has its own build instructions in its own directory.
